## Overview

This repository includes examples across various Python topics, such as:

- Data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Working with APIs and web scraping

Each folder in the repository contains standalone Python scripts with detailed comments, problem descriptions, and solutions.

## Sample Projects

Here are a few highlight projects available in this repository:

1. **Weather Data Visualizer**  
   Visualize real-time weather data from APIs using `Matplotlib`. [Explore here](https://github.com/example/python-practicum/tree/main/weather-visualizer).

2. **Benford's Law Analyzer**  
   Analyze large datasets to observe how they align with Benford‚Äôs Law. [Check it out](https://github.com/example/python-practicum/tree/main/benford-analyzer).

3. **Web Scraping for Movie Reviews**  
   Use `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to scrape and analyze movie reviews from popular websites. [View the project](https://github.com/example/python-practicum/tree/main/movie-scraping).
